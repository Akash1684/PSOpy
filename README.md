Python Implementation of Particle Swarm Optimizer

Particle Swarm Optimization:
---
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a stochastic population-based, self-adaptive search optimization algorithm.This method is 
inspired by social behaviour of animals such as bird flocking etc. It is a metaheuristic algorithm like genetic algorithm, 
ant colony etc. PSO is highly popular optimization technique due to its ease of implementation and high convergence rate towards
the optimal solution. Alike other population-based optimization methods, the particle swarm algorithm begins with the initialization
of a population of particles (or potential solution) randomly in the search space.
